# Wiki

Shareable Codex skills for Morgan's repositories.

Shared code-shape guidance is packaged as
[`use-morgs32-wiki-patterns`](./skills/use-morgs32-wiki-patterns/SKILL.md), with its
self-contained references under
[`references/patterns`](./skills/use-morgs32-wiki-patterns/references/patterns/index.md).
Keep only project-specific profiles, overrides, and domain guidance in
consuming repositories; do not vendor this repository for the shared
patterns.

## Install

`~/.agents/skills` is a live symlink to this repository's [`skills/`](./skills/)
directory. Edit skills here; that checkout **is** the global install. Do not
treat `~/.agents/skills/**` as a separate generated copy.

Configure one or more consuming repositories' managed `AGENTS.md` blocks:

```bash
node skills/use-morgs32-wiki-patterns/scripts/configure.mjs /path/to/repository
```

When `~/.agents/skills` already symlinks into this checkout, the command skips
Skills CLI global install/update and only owns the marker-bounded
`Shared patterns` block in each root `AGENTS.md`. It preserves surrounding
guidance, normalizes a lowercase root `agents.md`, and never edits nested or
vendored agent files. Pass multiple repository paths to update them together,
or use `--check` for a read-only drift check.

## Publish and update shared guidance

Use
[`update-morgs32-wiki`](./skills/update-morgs32-wiki/SKILL.md)
to publish pattern or skill source changes:

1. Work on `main` in this checkout. `git pull` if remote `main` has moved.
2. Change `skills/use-morgs32-wiki-patterns/`, update its pattern index when needed,
   and validate the skill.
3. Commit on `main` and push when asked. A pull request is optional.
4. After the change is on remote `main`, refresh managed repository guidance:

   ```bash
   node skills/use-morgs32-wiki-patterns/scripts/configure.mjs /path/to/repository
   ```

Do not refresh consuming-repo guidance from an unmerged PR. `update-wiki-patterns`
updates only a consuming repository's `{root}/wiki/patterns/**` guidance.
