# Cleanup

Surface architectural friction and propose **deepening opportunities**: refactors that turn shallow modules into deep ones. The aim is testability and AI-navigability.

This command is _informed_ by the project's domain model and built on a shared design vocabulary:

- Read [rubber-duck’s design reference](../rubber-duck/references/codebase-design.md) for the architecture vocabulary (**module**, **interface**, **depth**, **seam**, **adapter**, **leverage**, **locality**) and its principles (the deletion test, "the interface is the test surface", "one adapter = hypothetical seam, two = real"). Use these terms exactly in every suggestion, and don't drift into "component," "service," "API," or "boundary."
- The domain language in `CONTEXT.md` gives names to good seams; ADRs in `docs/adr/` record decisions this command should not re-litigate.

## When to run which path

Default `/cleanup` runs the architecture scan below (Explore → HTML report → grilling).

Skip the HTML survey and read [make-obvious](references/make-obvious.md) when the user named a slice, or asked for slop, prune, simplify, `/cleanup-mode`, judge, imports, or casts.

After the user picks a report candidate that is a local simplify rather than a deepening, read that same reference before editing.

## Process

### 1. Explore

**Scope before you scan: YAGNI.** Deepening a module pays off by making future changes to it easier, so put extra weight on the parts of the codebase that have recently changed. Decide *where* to look before you look:

- If the user named a direction (a module, a subsystem, a pain point), take it, and skip the inference below.
- Otherwise, walk back a good stretch of the commit history (`git log --oneline`) to find the codebase's hot spots, the files and areas that keep coming up, and let those paths pull your attention first. If the changes are scattered with no clear hot spot, widen the net.

Read the project's domain glossary (`CONTEXT.md`) and any ADRs in the area you're touching first.

Then spawn a sub-agent to walk the codebase. Don't follow rigid heuristics; explore organically and note where you experience friction:

- Where does understanding one concept require bouncing between many small modules?
- Where are modules **shallow**, with an interface nearly as complex as the implementation?
- Where have pure functions been extracted just for testability, but the real bugs hide in how they're called (no **locality**)?
- Where do tightly-coupled modules leak across their seams?
- Which parts of the codebase are untested, or hard to test through their current interface?

Apply the **deletion test** to anything you suspect is shallow: would deleting it concentrate complexity, or just move it? A "yes, concentrates" is the signal you want.

#### Scan for overload

Treat **overload** and **props discrimination** as the same reliable signal that a **module** **interface** is too wide — a **shallow** contract pretending to serve two workflows.

Look for:

- TypeScript overloads that hide a branch
- union props with incompatible required fields
- a runtime discriminator such as `if ('payload' in props)`, a tag match, or a `kind` switch over two disparate props shapes

If the branches have different callers, required inputs, failure meaning, or lifetimes, the current **interface** is dishonest. That is a deepening candidate: split into two named **modules**, or deepen one and stop pretending they share a contract. Splitting restores **locality**. Do not rewrite during Explore; surface the candidate in the report.

#### Scan for misnamed files

A file's basename must match its primary export exactly (`mintCommandId.ts` exports `mintCommandId`).

A source file almost always has exactly one export. Extra exports in the same file are a cleanup candidate.

Exceptions:

- a `utils/` folder
- a barrel (`index.ts` / worker entrypoint) that only re-exports. Implementation does not live in the barrel.

Typecheck and unit-spec files follow the **sibling subject**, not their own export (they usually have none):

- A collocated `*.typecheck.*` or unit `*.spec.*` is named after the sibling source file, or lives in the subject folder as `subject/subject.ts` + `subject/subject.typecheck.ts`.
- A typecheck that imports several factories with no same-named sibling (e.g. `makeAppFrontends.typecheck.tsx` covering `makeSession` / `makeRuntime` / …) is a misnamed-file candidate: split the assertions into each subject's typecheck.
- Leave intentional workflow/e2e suites that live under `tests/` alone. Facet suffixes (`*ImportFailure`, `GatewayApi.access`) are candidates to merge into the primary subject's existing test file unless the user keeps them as a deliberate exception.

Surface misnamed files and multi-export files as report candidates (rename, split, or move the extra export into its own same-named file). Do not rewrite them during Explore.

### 2. Present candidates as an HTML report

Write a self-contained HTML file to the OS temp directory so nothing lands in the repo. Resolve the temp dir from `$TMPDIR`, falling back to `/tmp` (or `%TEMP%` on Windows), and write to `<tmpdir>/architecture-review-<timestamp>.html` so each run gets a fresh file. Open it for the user (`xdg-open <path>` on Linux, `open <path>` on macOS, `start <path>` on Windows) and tell them the absolute path.

The report uses **Tailwind via CDN** for layout and styling, and **Mermaid via CDN** for diagrams where a graph/flow/sequence reliably communicates the structure. Mix Mermaid with hand-crafted CSS/SVG visuals: use Mermaid when relationships are graph-shaped (call graphs, dependencies, sequences), and hand-built divs/SVG when you want something more editorial (mass diagrams, cross-sections, collapse animations). Each candidate gets a **before/after visualisation**. Be visual.

For each candidate, render a card with:

- **Files**: which files/modules are involved
- **Problem**: why the current architecture is causing friction
- **Solution**: plain English description of what would change
- **Benefits**: explained in terms of locality and leverage, and how tests would improve
- **Before / After diagram**: side-by-side, custom-drawn, illustrating the shallowness and the deepening
- **Recommendation strength**: one of `Strong`, `Worth exploring`, `Speculative`, rendered as a badge

End the report with a **Top recommendation** section: which candidate you'd tackle first and why.

**Use CONTEXT.md vocabulary for the domain, and the [rubber-duck design vocabulary](../rubber-duck/references/codebase-design.md) for the architecture.** If `CONTEXT.md` defines "Order," talk about "the Order intake module," not "the FooBarHandler," and not "the Order service."

**ADR conflicts**: if a candidate contradicts an existing ADR, only surface it when the friction is real enough to warrant revisiting the ADR. Mark it clearly in the card (e.g. a warning callout: _"contradicts ADR-0007, but worth reopening because…"_). Don't list every theoretical refactor an ADR forbids.

See [HTML-REPORT.md](HTML-REPORT.md) for the full HTML scaffold, diagram patterns, and styling guidance.

Do NOT propose interfaces yet. After the file is written, ask the user: "Which of these would you like to explore?"

### 3. Grilling loop

Once the user picks a candidate, walk the decision tree in this session. One question at a time. Cover constraints, dependencies, the shape of the deepened **module**, what sits behind the **seam**, and what tests survive. Do not call `grilling` or `domain-modeling`; those skills are not part of this package.

If the picked candidate is a local simplify rather than a deepening, read [make-obvious](references/make-obvious.md) before editing.

Side effects happen inline as decisions crystallize:

- **Naming a deepened module after a concept not already in the project's domain glossary?** If `CONTEXT.md` exists, add the term there. Otherwise keep the canonical name in the conversation; do not create `CONTEXT.md`.
- **Sharpening a fuzzy term during the conversation?** Update `CONTEXT.md` only when that file already exists.
- **User rejects the candidate with a load-bearing reason?** Offer an ADR only when the project already uses `docs/adr/` and the reason would stop a future scan from re-suggesting the same thing. Skip ephemeral reasons ("not worth it right now") and self-evident ones.
- **Want to explore alternative interfaces for the deepened module?** Read [rubber-duck’s Design It Twice guide](../rubber-duck/references/DESIGN-IT-TWICE.md) and use its parallel sub-agent pattern.
